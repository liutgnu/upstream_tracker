Overview
========

It is used for tracking the latest releases of opensource projects. Currently
it can track the upstream, fedora and rhel streams.

To track more opensource projects, add the projects url to main.cpp:upstream_project_urls.

To track more upstreams, for example rhel, implement the class as fedora_tracker or
upstream_tracker, then register it in tracker::init().
